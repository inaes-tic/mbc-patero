MBC-Patero:

This is basically MBC-Zumo ( https://github.com/inaes-tic/mbc-zumo ) using
Mongo and Redis to interact with MBC-Caspa.

It monitors an incoming folder for new files and queues them for transcoding,
adding them to Caspa when finished.

Installation:

All python libraries are listed inside requirements.txt and can be installed
with pip:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then copy defaults.json as config.json and edit to suit your system.
Of particular importance are the *_dir keys, best performance is achieved
when they are on the same filesystem as we can make hardlinks instead of
copying files. For now don't touch queue_coll and make sure that dbname
points to the same database that Caspa uses.

Many things aren't implemented yet, like rejecting bad files (different
framerate or size, etc) or automatically grabbing the same configuration
used by Caspa.
